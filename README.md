# HL7 Language Server for Visual Studio Code

This is a plugin for Visual Studio Code that provides language server support
for HL7 messages. It uses the [hl7-ls](https://github.com/hamaluik/hl7-ls)
language server to parse HL7 messages and provides several core LSP features
for HL7 messages.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

This plugin requires that you have the `hl7-ls` language server installed. You
can install it by following the instructions in the
[hl7-ls](https://github.com/hamaluik/hl7-ls) repository.

### Configuration

The path to the `hl7-ls` executable must be set in the `hl7-ls.executablepath`
setting. This can be done in the user settings or workspace settings. For
example:

```json
{
    "hl7-ls.executablepath": "/path/to/hl7-ls"
}
```

## Usage

This plugin creates the `hl7` filetype, and will automatically start the
language server when you open a file with the `hl7` filetype. The language
server will parse the HL7 message and provide diagnostics, hover information,
completion suggestions, and more.

## TODO

- [ ] Add support for the send message command
